## What
 ***Who's that Pokemon?*** is a *game* that tests the players Pokemon knowledge. You get to watch your score count go up when you choose the correct Pokemon the hints point towards.
 
## Why
 This project was made to illustrate some of the capabilities fetching data from an API has to offer when using JavaScript. Since the majority of its content relied on fetched data, such capabilities demonstrated the power of storing and displaying the data. 
 
## How
 The languages used to make this project were *HTML*, *CSS*(**Bootstrap**), and *JavaScript*. All images and *Hint* keywords are fetched and taken from ***PokeAPI***.
 
## Page Description
 A container holding all the elements sits at the center of the page. Inside of it, at the top left is the name of the "*game*" and underneath it are the score counter, Pokemon and the hints. Four Pokemon have their backs turned to you and when you click on one of them, a "pop up" appears that displays a front view Pokemon and a message. Your decision should be based on the three hints that correspond to the one Pokemon. Whether you choose the correct Pokemon or not, a front view of the correct Pokemon will appear regardless. The only thing that appears different when choosing right or wrong is the message inside of the "pop up". When you continue, the "pop up" closes, the Pokemon and hints refresh, and the score counter adjusts.
