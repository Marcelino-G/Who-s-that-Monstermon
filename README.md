- To test a friend's Pokemon Knowledge. 
 
## Sources

## Instructions
You are provided with 2 sections, one displays 4 Pokemon and the other displays 3 hints. The three hints point toward **ONE** of the pokemon.

## Page Description
 A container holding all the elements sits at the center of the page. Inside of it, at the top left is the name of the "game" and underneath it are the score counter, Pokemon, and the hints. Four Pokemon have their backs turned to you and when you click on one of them, a "pop up" appears that displays a front view Pokemon and a message. Your decision should be based on the three hints that correspond to the one Pokemon. Whether you choose the correct Pokemon or not, a front view of the correct Pokemon will appear regardless. The only thing that appears different when choosing right or wrong is the message inside of the "pop up". When you continue, the "pop up" closes, the Pokemon and hints refresh, and the score counter adjusts.
